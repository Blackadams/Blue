<p class="mb-8">Personal experience as a student undertaking maritime education projects, a glaring learning experience shows that we are yet to incorporate maritime education into middle level schooling curricular – one of the reasons for the creation of this platform </p>

                <p class="mb-8">The objective of Blue Desk is to build on interconnected elements that contribute to the success of maritime education and learning, ocean environmental sustainability, sea-people cohabitation, trade and economic considerations, collaboration between learners, governments, regulators, shipping and other stakeholders, local & international partners, the campaign for equitable and effective governance, and more. This comprehensive approach is essential to fostering a thriving and responsible ocean planet for all.</p>

                <p class="mb-8">The Climate Crisis has taught us that acknowledging the protection and better management of our ocean environmental is key. The Blue Desk recognizes that the health and resilience of our oceans is vital not just for sustainable development, but for our very existence.  Africa’s youth must be involved in learning about responsible practices, conservation efforts, and sustainable resource management so that they are prepared to become able long-term stewards our oceans, rivers, and all marine ecosystems.</p>

                <p class="mb-8">For purpose of integrating environmental considerations into well balanced policies and practices, the Blue Desk hopes to aid in efforts towards youth-led initiatives to minimize pollution, promote biodiversity, protect sensitive habitats, and encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources. Through these efforts, the Blue Desk strives for a harmonious balance between economic growth and environmental preservation.</p>

                <p class="mb-8">Collaboration and partnerships are also key components of the Blue Desk. Recognizing that the challenges and opportunities within the Blue Economy are multifaceted, we look forward to engaging with various stakeholders.</p>

                <p class="mb-8">All communities are encouraged to come together to share knowledge, drive innovation, and collectively address common challenges. Collaborative initiatives foster a spirit of cooperation, promote interdisciplinary approaches, and encourage the exchange of best practices. By leveraging the power of collaboration, we seek to unlock the full potential of our shared heritage – the Ocean, from whence all life originated</p>

                <p class="mb-8">The Blue Desk has been created to inform, educate and inspire young people, students and indigenous communities across the country in Kenya, the East African Region, the African continent in the knowledge and stewardship of the Ocean and all related maritime affairs. As the old saying goes: ‘the current generation has but borrowed the earth and the oceans from the future generation’. </p>

                <p class="mb-8">The realm of the Blue Economy, where sustainable ocean resource utilization takes center stage, the "Blue Desk" idea has been conceptualized as a platform to engage and share information – specifically with the youth in Africa and the World, of the many areas of importance encapsulated in the marine industry. Beyond traditional economic activities, the Blue Desk focusses on the educational dimension, highlighting marine-centered learning institutions, program availability, and up-coming events in Ocean affairs.</p>

                <p class="mb-8"> Today, environmental considerations that influence the development of marine-related industries takes center stage, as evidenced in the recently concluded Climate Action Conference hosted in Nairobi, Kenya last week. In this blog entry, we shall delve into the multifaceted aspects of this critical sector and explore its significance to help us create, protect and grow a thriving and responsible Blue Economy.</p>

                <p class="mb-8">Education plays a pivotal role in equipping individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate the complexities of the marine industry. Marine-centered learning institutions, specialized programs, and research centers serve as vital hubs for nurturing talent and fostering innovation.</p>

During this season, we salute men and women we are privileged to have interacted with, who work tirelessly in their respective dockets, giving us hope of a cleaner, greener/bluer, and more sustainable future. <br>

There is no more extraordinary untapped resource than the creativity and minds of our youth, filled with ideas and the desire to change the world. This youth-led mission is not to promote the Blue Economy and empower the youth through one of East Africa’s largest industries—the Blue Economy.
